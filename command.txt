Commands to install typescript:

Typescript installation:

     npm install --global typescript

Change the Execution Policy for the Current User:
    
     Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

   - This command changes the execution policy only for your user account without requiring admin rights.

     tsc -v

   - This should now display the TypeScript version without the script execution error.
